# Children's Book

This is a children's book app developed using the `@landbot/core` to interact with the book definition stored in a chatbot at LandBot.

## Journal

I decided to keep a journal of my progress and thoughts during the development of this project. You can find it [here](./docs/journal.md).

## How to run

The old classic:

```bash
npm run dev
```
